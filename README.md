## 📌 Project Overview

This project contains a structured QA test suite for the **SauceDemo** e-commerce demo application. The goal is to validate the complete user flow — from authentication to order completion — ensuring all critical features behave as expected across different user roles and edge cases.

The tests follow a real-world e-commerce workflow:

```
Login → Product Page → Add to Cart → Remove from Cart → Checkout → Payment → Order Confirmation
```
